# Gibbs-sampler

This is the complementary code assignment. The task is to implement standard Gibbs and collapse Gibbs on NIPS data for LDA (Latent Dirichilet Allocation), which is a topic model that defines multiple mixtures of discrete distributions with shared components.

The [data](https://github.com/YanSong97/Gibbs-sampler/tree/master/data) folder contains the pre-processed nips data and vocabulary file.

The [src](https://github.com/YanSong97/Gibbs-sampler/tree/master/src) folder contains the source code and a demo notobook.
